To ensure the app always displays the most up-to-date Bitcoin prices while minimizing unnecessary server requests, implement a timestamp mechanism. Store the time when the Bitcoin prices are fetched and saved locally. Each time the app is opened, or at regular intervals, compare the current time with the stored timestamp. If the difference exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 1 hour), fetch the updated prices from the server. This approach balances the need for timely data with the efficiency of reduced server calls.
